# TableTalk

_Your data has something to say._

TableTalk transforms your database into a conversation partner. Ask questions in plain English, get answers that make sense. No more context-switching between query tools – just you and your data, having a chat.

## Why TableTalk?

Ever wished you could just ask your database what's going on? That's TableTalk. We've taken the power of SQL and wrapped it in something that feels as natural as messaging a friend. Perfect for:

- Developers who want to quickly explore their data without writing queries
- Teams who need to share database insights without sharing database credentials
- Anyone who's ever stared at a JOIN statement and thought "there has to be a better way"

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Smart Query Translation**: We handle the SQL behind the scenes
- **History & Context**: Your database never forgets the conversation
- **Local-First Architecture:** Runs entirely on your machine with Ollama

## Behind the Scenes

TableTalk is crafted with:

- Electron for the stage
- React for the performance
- Ollama for the intelligence
- SQLite for the data foundation

## The Story Behind TableTalk

Born from countless late-night debugging sessions and the simple thought: "What if databases could explain themselves?" We built TableTalk because we believe data should be accessible, not intimidating.

Made with ♥️ by developers who think databases deserve better conversation skills.
